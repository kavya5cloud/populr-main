 * fallback was wrong and silent, waiting for the day someone cleared that variable. On that
 * day every canonical on the site would have pointed at a host that 308s away, which is the
 * single most effective way to tell Google your pages are duplicates of somewhere else.
 *
 * A default that is only correct because something else overrides it is not a default.
 * It now matches what the domain actually serves.
 *
 * www and non-www serving the same content is duplicate content, so one must redirect to the
 * other. That redirect lives in Vercel's domain settings, not in this app — see
 * NON_CANONICAL_HOST. Everything that emits a URL reads this constant.
