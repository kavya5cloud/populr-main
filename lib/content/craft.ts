//
//   Rules that go into the prompt, teaching the moves that make writing land.

export const CRAFT_RULES = `HOW TO WRITE IT

The first line decides whether the rest is read. Two openings earn attention, and nothing
else does.

One: something concrete — a specific moment, an actual number from the context, a thing that
broke, a sentence someone really said.

Two: a flat contrarian claim the reader will want to argue with. "There are no bad marketing
channels." "Nobody reads your case studies." State it and stop; do not soften it, do not
hedge it, do not explain it in the same sentence. Then earn it in the lines below.

Never open on a definition, on a question you are about to answer yourself, or on a thesis
you immediately restate. If your first sentence would work as the summary of the post,
delete it and start at the second.

Have one point. A post that makes three arguments makes none — pick the sharpest and cut
the others, however true they are.

Vary the rhythm. Machine writing runs at one length: fourteen words, fourteen words,
fourteen words. Put a four-word sentence after a long one. Let a paragraph be a single line
when the line earns it.

Say the uncomfortable part. The posts people forward are the ones that admit a cost, name a
tradeoff, or disagree with something the reader already believes. Safe writing is forgettable
writing — but never manufacture a controversy the business does not actually hold.

Earn the ending. Do not summarise what you just said; the reader was there. End on the
sharpest line, a real question, or simply stop.

Write like one person talking to one person. No "businesses today". No "we all know".
Second person, plain verbs, contractions where they fall naturally.

Concrete beats clever. One real detail from the context above is worth more than any
turn of phrase.`;

/* ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Shape.

   Everything above is about sentences. Nothing was about structure, so every
   post came out as the same thing: three paragraphs of good prose. Good prose
   in an identical container reads as a feed of one post repeated, which is the
   real reason generated content feels lifeless — not the words, the sameness.

   The shapes below are structures, not templates. Observed evidence for caring:
   on a competitor's timeline the best-written insight took 32 likes across 3.2K
   views, and a post whose entire body was ASCII art took 112 across 7.9K. The
   drawing was not smarter. It was shaped differently from everything around it.
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

export const POST_SHAPES = `PICK A SHAPE

Do not default to paragraphs. Choose the shape that fits what you have to say,
and do not use the same one twice in a row.

The claim. One flat line nobody can read neutrally, then the case for it in three
short lines. Strongest when you are disagreeing with something the reader already
believes.

The list. A line of setup, then dashes. Three items, not five — five reads as
padding. Each item under twelve words. The list does the arguing; no summary
after it.

The walkthrough. Numbered or arrowed steps of something real you can actually do.
"> paste your url  > it reads the page  > you approve" beats any description of a
feature. Works when the product genuinely is the answer.

The receipt. A decision and its reason, stated flatly: what was skipped, and why.
No adjectives. This is the shape nobody else in the category can use, because it
requires having actually decided something.

The comparison. Two things in two columns of plain text, or two lines with the
same grammar. Let the gap between them make the point.

The picture. A tiny diagram, a bit of ASCII, a shape made of characters. Rare, so
it stops a scroll — and worth it only when it carries the idea rather than
decorating it. Never more than once a week.`;

export const INTERACTION = `LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN

A post that closes completely gets read and forgotten. One that leaves something
unresolved gets answered.

End on a real question when you have one — something you genuinely do not know
the answer to, that the reader plausibly does. "What did you try before this?"
"Which of these does your team actually do?"

This is the opposite of the rhetorical question banned below. The test is simple:
if you answer it yourself in the next line, delete it. If a stranger could answer
it better than you, keep it.

Other ways to leave the door open: state the version you disagree with and invite
the correction; give three options and ask which; admit the part you have not
worked out.

Never "thoughts?", never "agree?", never "let me know in the comments". Those are
requests for engagement. A real question is a request for an answer.`;

/* ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Being found.

   Everything above makes a post worth reading once someone sees it. None of it
   helps them see it. The rules permitted up to two hashtags and never once asked
   for one, and said nothing at all about the words people actually search — so
   posts came out clean, well-shaped, and invisible.
   ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

export const DISCOVERY = `BE FINDABLE

Use the words your buyer would type. If they search "crm for small sales teams",
those words belong in the first two lines — not "revenue orchestration platform".
Take the terms from the context above; do not invent a vocabulary the market does
not use.

Once each, where it reads naturally. A post written for a search engine reads like
one, and people leave. The test: read the line aloud. If nobody would say it that
way, the keyword is doing damage.

Hashtags are for discovery, not decoration, and they work differently per place:

LinkedIn — two or three, specific. #b2bsales finds an audience; #marketing finds
forty million posts and nobody. Put them on their own line at the end.

Instagram, Threads — up to three, specific to the niche, at the end.

X — one at most, and usually none. Tags do not drive reach there and read as
someone trying to be found rather than someone worth reading.

Reddit, Hacker News — none, ever. A hashtag marks you as a marketer in a room that
removes marketers.

Never the generic set: #marketing #growth #ai #startup #business #success. They
are the hashtag equivalent of "in today's fast-paced world" — they signal that
nobody chose them.`;

export const CRAFT_BANS = `NEVER WRITE

- These phrases, in any form: ${AI_TELLS.slice(0, 24).join("; ")}.
- Any variant of "studies show" or "experts agree" — if you have no source, make the argument without one.
- Rhetorical questions you immediately answer ("So what does this mean? It means…").
- A closing summary of the post the reader has just read.
- Emoji as bullet points, or more than one emoji in total.

  reddit: `Reddit: you are a person in a thread, not a brand. Lead with the answer or the experience, not context. Mention the product only if it is genuinely the answer, and disclose the connection plainly. Any marketing cadence gets the post removed and the account remembered.`,
