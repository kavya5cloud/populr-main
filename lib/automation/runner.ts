// Executing a due slot.
//
// The entire publishing act — adapter call, retry, backoff, dead-letter, history — belongs
// to the M12 Publishing Engine. This file decides *whether* a slot may run, hands it over,
// and records what came back. It contains no HTTP call to any platform, by design.
//
// Two properties matter more than anything else here:
//
//   Locking. A slot moves upcoming → publishing before any work starts, and the move is
//   rejected if it is not currently upcoming. Two overlapping cron runs therefore cannot
//   both claim the same slot.
//
//   Idempotency. The publish request carries an idempotency key derived from the slot id,
//   which the Publishing Engine already de-duplicates on. Even if the lock were somehow
//   bypassed — a crash between claim and publish, a replayed request — the same slot can
//   never post twice.
