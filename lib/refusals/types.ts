// What Populr declined to do, and why.
//
// Every competitor in this category sells volume: more agents, more posts, more channels,
// published automatically. Populr's actual argument is the opposite — that most marketing work
// is not worth doing, and the valuable act is refusing it with a reason attached.
//
// Until now that argument was copy. The landing page said "skipped · won't rank", the dashboard
// said it, and nothing recorded it. A claim nobody keeps score of is a slogan, and a slogan is
// exactly what a competitor can put on their own site by Friday.
//
// This makes it a record. Each refusal is stored with what was proposed, why it was declined,
// what was done instead, and — later, once the window has passed — whether the call was right.
// That last part is the whole point: it is the one claim in this category that cannot be
// asserted, because making it requires having declined things and then having been checked.
//
// The honesty constraint that governs the rest of this codebase applies hardest here. A
// verdict is only ever written from measured evidence. `unknown` is a normal, common, and
// permanent state — most refusals are never conclusively resolved, and saying so is the
// difference between a ledger and a marketing asset.
