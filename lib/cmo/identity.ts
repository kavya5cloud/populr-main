// lib/cmo/quality-rules.ts asks the model not to disclose the vendor behind it, and the

// prompt rule is a preference and the one place it fails is the one place it matters: a
// founder asking "what are you" and pasting the answer somewhere.
//
// The hard constraint is that vendor names are not forbidden words. A customer selling
// developer tools may compete with OpenAI; a post about AI search has to be able to say
// Gemini. Stripping those would break real marketing copy to solve a self-reference problem.
//
// So every pattern here is anchored on the model talking about *itself*. "OpenAI raised a
// round" survives. "I am an OpenAI model" does not. That distinction is the whole design,
// and it is why these are sentence-level regexes rather than a word list.
