// Shared scaffold for every studio section. Sections whose job is writing lead with the
// Composer; every asset kind generates through the Job Engine. The "Soon" badges are gone
// because the work behind them is done — a disabled-looking card next to a working button
// was the worst of both.

// The FIRST_STEP lines that used to live here are gone with the pages that showed them.
// Every one was for a media surface: videos now leads with the Composer in its own
// VideoScript page, images and motion redirect, and ugc never rendered this component at
// all. Two of those four lines were also claims — "every image is generated against your
// brand", "Populr storyboards it" — about work nothing in the codebase does.
